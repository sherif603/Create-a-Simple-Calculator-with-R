# Statistical Programming Languages
Among the statistical programming languages, both Python and R are widely used for statistical analysis or machine learning projects.
But there are others â€“ such as Java, Scala, MatLab, or even SQL which not only allow you to access data directly but also allow for statistical analysis.
In the early 1990s, the R programming language was originally created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Department of Statistics of the University 
of Auckland in New Zealand, and it was named after them. Subsequently, a large group of individuals contributed to R by sending code and bug reports.

# R Programming Language
R is an open-source software within the GNU package, for statistical computing and graphics, it compiles and runs on a wide variety of Linux platforms,
Windows, and Mac OS. The simplest way to install the program is to follow the online instructions and use the default options. 
Because R is open-source software, it contains hundreds of packages developed by researchers around the world for various statistical analyses and data mining.

Rmetrics is a free, open-source, and open development software project for teaching computational finance. 
The project was created in 2001 by Dr. Diethelm Wuertz and his associates in Zurich, Switzerland, and has many useful packages such as fBasics, fGarch,
and fPortfolio. Website: https://www.rmetrics.org.

# RStudio, IDE
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
It adds modern features like syntax highlighting and code refactoring to R. In other words, it brings all the features that you need together in one place.
It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio
using web browser. You can download and Install RStudio IDE via (www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

# Create a simple calculator with R

Defining functions help in organizing the code and allow to re-use code fragments whenever you need. I define functions to apply arithmetic operations 
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divistion.

Decision making is an important part of programming. This can be achieved in R programming using the conditional if...else statement.
I used the If...else statements to call the related functions based on the user input.

I used readline() function in R to read text lines from an input file, however, I used as.integer() function to transform a character object into an integer object.

In R Console:
Firstly, you may enter your arithmetic operation type number 
1 - Addition
2 - Subtraction
3 - Multiplication
4 - Division
Second, enter the first number,
Third, enter the second number.
